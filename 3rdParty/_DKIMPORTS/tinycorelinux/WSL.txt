Here are some preliminary results of my attempt to get TinyCore running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
This can be an alternative to the other Virtual-Machine options.
For more information on this technique https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/

What I did, was making a tar file from a running (live) TinyCore system, including installed tce extensions by running this command:

$ sudo su
# cd /
# tar -cvpf tinycore.tar --exclude=tinycore.tar --exclude=proc --exclude=dev --exclude=sys /

This file is needed to 'install' it on the WSL system.
First have the Windows WSL system up and running, this is a trickey part because there are so many Windows distributions out there, after some experiments this was my summary of actions:
Search for PowerShell, richt click and run as Administrator and execute these 2 commands:

Code: [Select]
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform

After this, you have to reboot your windows system.

In the process of importing the tar file (later on) i got an error 'FATAL: kernel to old'
I did some of these things (not sure which solved it) and the error went away:

Download the 'kernel' update package from
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

Execute on windows:

Code: [Select]
wsl_update_x64.msi

In PowerShell execute:

Code: [Select]
> wsl --set-default-version 2

If all goes well, it is time to 'import' our tar file into the WSL system.
Choose your destination directory, for me it was c:\temp\TinyCore
Execute this command in PowerShell:

Code: [Select]
> wsl --import TinyCore c:\temp\TinyCore .\tinycore.tar

Make sure to use the new WSL kernel on our TinyCore distribution.
Execute this command in PowerShell:

Code: [Select]
> wsl --set-version TinyCore 2
(takes some minutes....)

Time to 'boot' your TinyCore system, execute in PowerShell:

Code: [Select]
> wsl -d TinyCore

For the result see the attachement. All works, including tce-load etc.
The backup / restore features of TinyCore are a bit crippled,
and my 'sda1' user disk is turned into a directory.

So keep in mind it has some caveats.
