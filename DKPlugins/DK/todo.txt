~! THE LIST !~    2.0

*** PRIORITY ***
Make this list the default background on your phone.  ;)
So every time you open your phone you see this. :)
I.E.    aquawicket.com/list


*** LOOK ***
See if we have some 3/4" conduit + T's plus elbows.


*** BUY ***
2 = 4x4 x 6' Treated posts
100ft Spool 14/2 romex/ if lights on outside posts.
50ft Spool 14/2 romex/ if lights on the inside posts.


*** DO ***
Scrape the entry line on the inside of the gate and replant the curb wood.
Drag a conduit line across the outside of the footing to the other "post"




*** DIGITALKNOB ***
We got a bad thing going on with DKWidget_CreateElement() returning a name.
That function will return the id of the created element..  
And here's the snuiff..   if the name id already exists, it will spin a number system after.
If we need an id name finding system, that should be a seperate function.
We need to find remove DKWidget_CreateElement..  thanks

Since it uses a counter to create new names..  it's a shortcut function that will cause some work.


I think we need to get rid of DKINSTALL in all the DKCMake stuff.
I think it can add confussion and it only uses a few lines to download and install
 


Move all DKWidget functions into DK.js
Then move all gui related js up to DKRml.js
DK.js will have access to a C++ EventTarget
In fact, all C++ OOP structure will follow W3 javascript naming standards.

make a "raw key" to "w3 standard key translation"..    int 43 = "KeyY"    ;)
Translate all keycodes to internet w3 standards from raw code

We want to code from inside DK..  DKNotepad and DKSolution should get us there.
P.S. DKSolution needs to get renamesd to DKFileExplorer    

*** DKNotepad ***
Get DKNotepad to listen for Ctrl + s
DKNotepadFile_Exit() breaks DK_Close()
Get Copy and Paste working
Remove save comfrimation and make a sparkle, or something
 
 

convert DKSDLRocket in DKTestApps to DKSDLRml

*** DKTUTORIAL ***
DK1:   DKCmake build system
DK2:   DK C++ w/ nothing
DK3:   DK C++ w/Javascript (DKDuktape)  =  OM  "Object Model" 
DK4:   DK C++ w/ javascript (DKDuktape) +  DKRml = DOM "Document Object Model"
* This is how DKTestApps should be named *


If you get DKDom as a seperate RmlUi Library, poeple WILL chip in. ;)   DO IT! DO IT! :D

Remodel DK/Events.cpp after javascript EventTarget by creating DK/EventTarget.h/cpp

Go pick up your I7 from storage

Rename Github MyApps to DKMyApps
Get DKTestAll Working on Linux
Compile Everything for win64
Hint: Their may be a new SDL2Android thing in 3rdParty. ANDROID

*** Javascript ***
EventTarget is lower than Window. Use that for javascript without a document context.
ALL C++ Javascript functions now require a CPP_ prefix
Proper naming would be CPP_DKPlugin_Function
DK Javascript functions are just DKPlugin_Function 

*** DK.js ***
Make sure all function are prefixed with DK_
i.e.  DK_Function(var)

** Eliminate DKWidget
Let continue to strip down DKWidget.js because it's all moving to DK.js and DKWidget is gone.

*** ALWAYS ***
 replace all == with ===
 replace all != with !==

*** DKDomEvent ***
* add removeEventListener everywhere neccesary 
* Make EVERY event go through DKDomEventTarget.js event without a DOM
* keep track of events in DKDomEventTarget.js
