~! THE LIST !~    02/09/21

*** DIGITALKNOB ***
*******************
Move all github wiki into DK.Readme.md and remove all wiki
Remove github Wiki and create an example just like /DKPlugins/index.html
Create a fork of RmlUi with a javascript folder for the document object, then dom

Go over DKFile.js and alphabatize functions

I think we need to get rid of DKINSTALL in all the DKCMake stuff.
I think it can add confussion and it only uses a few lines to download and install
 

Move all gui related js to DKGui.js
DK.js will have access to a C++ EventTarget
In fact, all C++ OOP structure will follow W3 javascript naming standards.

make a "raw key" to "w3 standard key translation"..    int 43 = "KeyY"    ;)
Translate all keycodes to internet w3 standards from raw code

DKSolution needs to get renamesd to DKFileExplorer    

*** DKNotepad ***
textarea steals key events from documnet
Get DKNotepad to listen for Ctrl + s
DKNotepadFile_Exit() breaks DK_Close()
Get Copy and Paste working
Remove save comfrimation and make a sparkle, or something
 
 
convert DKSDLRocket in DKTestApps to DKSDLRml

*** DKTUTORIAL ***
DK1:   DKCmake build system
DK2:   DK C++ w/ nothing
DK3:   DK C++ w/Javascript (DKDuktape)  =  OM  "Object Model" 
DK4:   DK C++ w/ javascript (DKDuktape) +  DKRml = DOM "Document Object Model"
* This is how DKTestApps should be named *


If you get DKDom as a seperate RmlUi Library, poeple might chip in.

Remodel DK/Events.cpp after javascript EventTarget by creating DK/EventTarget.h/cpp


Rename Github MyApps to DKMyApps
Get DKTestAll Working on Linux
Compile Everything for win64
Hint: Their may be a new SDL2Android thing in 3rdParty. ANDROID

*** Javascript ***
EventTarget is lower than Window. Use that for javascript without a document context.
ALL C++ Javascript functions now require a CPP_ prefix
Proper naming would be CPP_DKPlugin_Function
DK Javascript functions are just DKPlugin_Function 

*** DK.js ***
Make sure all function are prefixed with DK_
i.e.  DK_Function(var)

** Eliminate DKWidget
Let continue to strip down DKWidget.js because it's all moving to DK.js and DKWidget is gone.

*** ALWAYS ***
 replace all == with ===
 replace all != with !==

*** DKDomEvent ***
* add removeEventListener everywhere neccesary 
* Make EVERY event go through DKDomEventTarget.js event without a DOM
* keep track of events in DKDomEventTarget.js
