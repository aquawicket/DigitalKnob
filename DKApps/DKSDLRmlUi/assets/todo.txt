Remodel DK/Events.cpp after javascript EventTarget by creating DK/EventTarget.h/cpp

Go pick up your I7 from storage

Rename Github MyApps to DKMyApps
Get DKTestAll Working on Linux
Compile Everything for win64
Hint: Their may be a new SDL2Android thing in 3rdParty.    !ANDROID!
Add DKBuilder to DKBinaries for win32 win 64 after tests

*** Javascript ***
EventTarget is lower than Window. Use that for javascript without a document context.
ALL C++ Javascript functions now require a CPP_ prefix
Proper naming would be CPP_DKPlugin_Function
DK Javascript functions are just DKPlugin_Function 

*** DK.js ***
Make sure all function are prefixed with DK_
i.e.  DK_Function(var)

** Eliminate DKWidget
Let continue to strip down DKWidget.js because it's all moving to DK.js and DKWidget is gone.

*** ALWAYS ***
 replace all == with ===
 replace all != with !==

*** DKNotepad ***
DKNotepadFile_Exit() breaks DK_Close()
 Make "Ctrl+S" save the file in DKNotepad
 Get Copy and Paste working
 Remove save comfrimation and make a sparkle, or something

*** DKDomEvent ***
* add removeEventListener everywhere neccesary 
* Make EVERY event go through DKDomEventTarget.js event without a DOM
* keep track of events in DKDomEventTarget.js
