// TODO //

Replace all coourances of DKCPP with CPP

*** DK Javascript ***
ALL C++ Javascript functions now REQUIRE a DKCPP_ prefix
Proper naming would be DKCPP_DKPlugin_Function

*** DK.js ***
Make sure all function are prefixed with DK_
i.e.  DK_Function(var)

*** FUN ***
Make the Atari tank game  :D

** Eliminate DKWidget
Let continue to strip down DKWidget.js because it's all moving to DK.js and DKWidget is gone.

*** ALWAYS ***
 replace all == with ===
 replace all != with !==

*** DKNotepad ***
 Make "Ctrl+Shift+S" save the file in DKNotepad
 Get Copy and Paste working
 Remove save comfrimation and make a sparkle, or something

*** DKDomEvent ***
* add removeEventListener everywhere neccesary 
* Make EVERY event go through DKDomEventTarget.js
* keep track of events in DKDomEventTarget.js
