~! THE LIST !~

DKCMake "done building" needs to show the system and architecture..
I.E.    "Done Building DKSDLRmlUi - Linux 64


convert DKSDLRocket in DKTestApps to DKSDLRml


*** DKTUTORIAL ***
DK1:   DKCmake build system
DK2:   DK C++ w/ nothing
DK3:   DK C++ w/Javascript (DKDuktape)  =  OM  "Object Model" 
DK4:   DK C++ w/ javascript (DKDuktape) +  DKRml = DOM "Document Object Model"


If you get DKDom as a seperate RmlUi Library, poeple WILL chip in. ;)   DO IT! DO IT! :D

Remodel DK/Events.cpp after javascript EventTarget by creating DK/EventTarget.h/cpp

Go pick up your I7 from storage

Rename Github MyApps to DKMyApps
Get DKTestAll Working on Linux
Compile Everything for win64
Hint: Their may be a new SDL2Android thing in 3rdParty. ANDROID

*** Javascript ***
EventTarget is lower than Window. Use that for javascript without a document context.
ALL C++ Javascript functions now require a CPP_ prefix
Proper naming would be CPP_DKPlugin_Function
DK Javascript functions are just DKPlugin_Function 

*** DK.js ***
Make sure all function are prefixed with DK_
i.e.  DK_Function(var)

** Eliminate DKWidget
Let continue to strip down DKWidget.js because it's all moving to DK.js and DKWidget is gone.

*** ALWAYS ***
 replace all == with ===
 replace all != with !==

*** DKNotepad ***
DKNotepadFile_Exit() breaks DK_Close()
 Make "Ctrl+S" save the file in DKNotepad
 Get Copy and Paste working
 Remove save comfrimation and make a sparkle, or something

*** DKDomEvent ***
* add removeEventListener everywhere neccesary 
* Make EVERY event go through DKDomEventTarget.js event without a DOM
* keep track of events in DKDomEventTarget.js
