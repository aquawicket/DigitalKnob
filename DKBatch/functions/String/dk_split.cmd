::# String/split(string, separator)
::# String/split(string, separator, array:optional)
::#
::#	The split() method of String values takes a pattern and divides this string into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, 
::# puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.
::#
::#	PARAMETERS
::#  separator
::# 	The pattern describing where each split should occur. Can be undefined, a string, or an object with a Symbol.split method â€” the typical example being a regular expression.
::# 	Omitting separator or passing undefined causes split() to return an array with the calling string as a single element. All values that are not undefined or objects with a
::# 	[Symbol.split]() method are coerced to strings.
::#   
::#  limit Optional
::#		A non-negative integer specifying a limit on the number of substrings to be included in the array. If provided, splits the string at each occurrence of the specified
::#		separator, but stops when limit entries have been placed in the array. Any leftover text is not included in the array at all.
::#
::#  Return value
::# 	If separator is a string, an Array of strings is returned, split at each point where the separator occurs in the given string.
::#		If separator is a regex, the returned Array also contains the captured groups for each separator match; see below for details. The capturing groups may be unmatched, 
::#		in which case they are undefined in the array.
