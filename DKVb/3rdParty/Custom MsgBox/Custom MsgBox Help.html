<H4>Introduction</H4>
&#160;&#160; The <B>Msg</B> class in the accompanying sample scripts
is a basic, custom message box that uses Internet Explorer to create message windows
that look very close to the way that system messages appear. <BR><BR>
&#160;&#160; When the class object is created
it looks in the Registry to get the default system colors. When class properties are set they
become the properties for the next message window display. By creating this MsgBox
as a class with properties it becomes very easy to customize - and re-customize -
message windows. <BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="Blue"><B> The message window is automatically displayed with default
system colors and is self-sizing. You only need to set the properties of Title, Caption, buttons, etc.</B></SPAN><BR><BR>

<HR>
<BR>
 <B>Paste the class at the end of any script. <BR>
Then create the object at script startup with:</B><BR><BR>
<PRE>
Dim Box
Set Box = New Msg</PRE>

&#160;&#160; ... And use the message box like so: <BR><BR>

<PRE>
  With Box
    .Title = "Message Box"
    .Caption = "Please answer Yes or no."
    .AddButton "Yes"
    .AddButton "No"
    Ret = .ShowMsg
  End With
</PRE>
The variable <B>Ret</B> would then return 1 if Yes was clicked and 2 if No was clicked.
<BR><BR>

<HR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="Maroon"><B>What's different in the 2012 version:</B></SPAN><BR>
&#160;&#160; This version of the MsgBox scripts has been adapted to deal with
restriction problems on IE7+ and Vista+. The main change is that the window used
to be an IE window with no border. (The title bar was a facsimile.) The new version is
actually a webpage in an HTA window. HTAs bypass security problems, meaning that
these scripts work easily on Windows Vista/7/8. A few minor changes have also been
made to improve the display and layout.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="Maroon"><B>Re-using the message window:</B></SPAN><BR>
&#160;&#160; You can then reuse the message window while the script
is running. Just call the <B>Clear</B> method to clear property values for the next
use. <B>In fact, reuse is the best way to use the class. </B>Some work is done
when the class is instantiated. It needs to read the Registry to find system colors 
But that work only needs to be done once while the class is in use. If you create
the class at script startup it will create an instance of WScript.Shell, do all the setup
work, then release the WScript.Shell object.<BR>
&#160;&#160; Wait until script end to set the class to Nothing.
While the script(s) is running any number of
message boxes can then be created without needing to refind colors.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="Maroon"><B>Self-sizing:</B></SPAN> <BR>
&#160;&#160; <B>The message window is self-sizing. In most cases it will look fine
with no effort.</B>
There are some inline comments in the sample script that explain
the self-sizing code. Briefly, the varying samples in the demo script have worked
well in tests but not all configurations will be ideal. The message window is sized
after all elements have been added and just before becoming visible. The size is
based primarily on the space taken up by buttons. The width of button area decides
the width of the window. You can optimize the layout by adjusting buttons, where necessary.
 The script attempts to size
the window with the best compromise between button dimensions and window
dimensions. You can alter the default sizing in the code if you want wider boxes,
or you can discreetly use wordy captions on your buttons to make a window wider.
For example, if there is a lot of text with just a YES and NO button then you'll get a high, thin msgbox.
 You could make
that msgbox window wider and more balanced-looking by using a button caption
like "Yes, I would like to proceed" in place of just "Yes".

<BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="Maroon"><B>Windows Skins note:</B></SPAN><BR> The function <B>GetColor()</B> in the 
Msg class calls the Registry to retrieve default system colors. The message window then uses the same colors
used for system message windows. On XP that will get the correct colors but if you use the "Luna" skin
display the message box will not be skinned. On Vista+, if you use the "Aero" transparent display, the transparency
shows on the window border because that is part of the window frame and not the webpage.

<H4>About Classes</H4>

&#160;&#160; If you don't know about how classes work then you're missing
a very handy aspect of VBScript (and many other programming languages). A
class is a programming expedient that provides a way to package code as
an independent unit for re-use.<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; This custom message box is written as a class so that it can be
easily added to other scripts. A class is a "practical unit of code" that constitutes
an object. That is, from the point of view of external code, a class is an interface
and it's inside is invisible. All you have to do is to write:<BR>
<PRE>  Class ClassName
       '-- class code goes here.
  End Class </PRE>
&#160;&#160; Everything between <B>Class</B> [class name] and <B>End Class</B> becomes internal to
the class object. When methods or variables are declared in a class as <B>Private</B>
their "scope", or visibility, does not extend outside the class. For example, you could declare the 
private variable "Object1" inside the class and use it to create an instance of the FileSystemObject. 
That variable, and the FSO instance, will not be visible outside of the class. The self-contained aspect
 of classes means that you can design a class as a custom object, choosing properties and methods to 
make visible by declaring them as <B>Public</B>, while the functionality behind those properties and methods is 
hidden inside the class.<BR><BR>
&#160;&#160;

   Since only the properties and methods of a class declared as Public are visible from outside the 
class, a class can be pasted into any number of scripts without having any effect on the operation 
of those scripts. It's like being able to paste the FileSystemObject into your script: Whether you 
use the object or not, it does not affect your script code because only the Public methods and 
properties are visible to the rest of the script. (Note, though, that public variables declared outside 
the class, in the same script, are visible from inside the class, so it's a good idea to use unique 
variable names inside script classes.)<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; So this <B>Msg</B> custom message box class can be safely pasted
at the end of any script to provide a message box object. Your script will see the <B>Msg</B>
class in the same way that it sees the FSO - as an external object that provides a number
of public methods and properties. If you want to alter the code in the <B>Msg</B> class,
or add new properties, you can also do that. For example, you could add code to show a title bar
icon. That code would be complex and would require re-writing the CSS/HTML code that creates
the message box. But once you worked out the code, the ability to show a chosen icon in the
title bar could be cleanly "exposed" on the class interface as a simple, new property named TitleBarIcon,
and someone using the class could then access that functionality with code such as:<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MsgObj.TitleBarIcon = "C:\smallLogo.gif".

<H6>Sub Init</H6>
<SPAN CLASS="Blue">&#149; Initializes IE to deal with IE8 bug.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="Purple">ex.: Box.Init</SPAN><BR><BR>

&#160;&#160;
With IE6 the Custom MsgBox class works fine. With IE8 there is a strange bug: The first
call fails, but all subsequent calls work fine, until next reboot. It's as though something
needs to be initialized. The demo script <SPAN CLASS="Maroon">Basic MsgBox Sample.vbs</SPAN>
calls <B>Init</B>. The other demo scripts do not. If you run one of the other scripts first, on a
system with IE8, you will see a message like, "Button 2 clicked." For some reason the first
message window (HTA instance) created does not display. Worse, despite not displaying, the
<B>ShowMsg</B> function still returns a button number, though the number is arbitrary!
<B>Init</B> deals with that problem
by creating a simple HTA instance briefly and then closing that window before it is visible.<BR><BR>

<B>Notes:</B> IE8, in general, seems to be slower than IE6 to load. The scripts respond almost
instantly on XP with IE6, but take 1-2 seconds to respond with IE8, on both XP and Win7. (Which
seems to indicate that Win7 bloat is not the culprit.) The optimum usage of <B>Init</B>, therefore, 
is to call it after creating the <B>Msg</B> class, but before a message window is
needed, so that when a message window <I>is</I> needed it will appear quickly.
<BR><BR>
&#160;&#160; <B>Init</B> is not necessary with IE6, but if your scripts <I>might</I> be used
with another IE version then it should be called.

<B>Notes:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; An icon image can be anything that IE will show: JPG, GIF, BMP.
Up to about 60 pixels wide it will show fine. If you use a very large image, over 100 pixels,
it may be necessary to modify the resizing code because the window width and height
do not take icon size into consideration.<BR><BR>

<H6>Property IconWidth</H6>
<SPAN CLASS="Blue">&#149; Sets width of image to show in upper left.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="Purple">ex.: Box.IconWidth = 32</SPAN><BR><BR>

<B>Notes:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; IconWidth must be set if an image is used. That value is needed for the
self-sizing aspect of the message window. An image will only be
included in the message window if the Icon property is a valid file path and IconWidth is greater than 0.<BR>
&#160;&#160; A picture can also be measured but that seemed like a lot of
extra code, in this case, without enough value. The aim was to create a class small
enough to be realistically used by pasting it into other scripts. If you wanted to add icon size
functionality to the <B>Icon</B> property, the following should work
to return image dimensions, but it will return a wrong value if fonts are set to large.<BR>

<SPAN CLASS="Purple">ex.: Box.Font = "Arial"</SPAN><BR><BR>

<B>Notes:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; You can use any installed font here, but a message box has
small text which is not anti-aliased (at least not on older systems). So many
fonts will probably be unsuitable for use because they simply won't show legible text.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="Purple">ex.: Box.AddButton "Yes"</SPAN><BR><BR>
<B>Notes:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; The self-sizing function of the message box works by first getting the
size of the button table the way that IE chooses to display it. That's done by starting
with a window width of 600 pixels so that IE is not restricted in how it sets up the table. The other parts of the 
message box window then get sized
in accordance with the button table width. The result is usually a well-balanced display in the message
window. That design can be used to affect the display of the message box. For example,
if you use a long caption and don't want it to display in a long, vertical message box, just
make the captions in your buttons longer. The affect will be to widen the message box.<BR>
Example: Instead of using: "Yes" and "No" you might use something like: "Yes, I would like to continue." and "No, quit now.".

<H6>Sub AddList(Item, Data)</H6>
<SPAN CLASS="Blue">&#149; Adds a list item to MsgBox. The first call to AddList automatically adds a list. (List is a dropdown
selector unless ListSize is used to make it show as a listbox.)
<B> Item</B> is text of list item. 
<B>Data</B> is any hidden text string to be stored with list item.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="Purple">ex.: Box.AddList "Choice one", "hidden data"</SPAN><BR><BR>

<B>Notes:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; Calling <B>AddList</B> one or more times will cause the list to show
in the message window (until the next time <B>Clear</B> is called). Each call to <B>AddList</B> adds one item to 
the list. The purpose of the <B>Data</B> parameter is to associate a hidden text string
with a specific list item for later processing. If no hidden data is needed the <B>Data</B> parameter can be "".<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; The default list display is a 1-line dropdown list. The <B>ListSize</B> property can be
used to show a normal listbox by designating the number of items to be visible.<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; If you want to be able to confirm whether an item was selected, make the first item blank. Internet Explorer
returns 0 (instead of the expected -1) when nothing has been selected. So a return of no selection cannot be distinguished
from first-item selection. To make the return unambiguous, the first call to AddList can be <I>AddList "", "" </I>.
 Then if there is no selection ListIndex will return 0 and ListText will return "". (Note that using a blank first line is
for a single-line dropdown list. It will
not look right in a multi-line listbox.<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; &#149; The width of dropdown is not figured into window size. The list width will
be dependent on the widest text item used. If you want to use long lines of text in the
dropdown then use long button captions so that list does not extend past edge of window. In other words, 
if you have one button that says, "OK" and a very short caption then your message window will be very small
and narrow. If you also have a list with long entries such as "second Tuesday of the month" then
your list will extend past the right side of the window.<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; By default <B>AddList</B> shows a single-line dropdown selector, which is
essentially a ListBox with one item showing. If <B>ListSize</B> is set to a number
greater than 1 a normal ListBox will be displayed with [ListSize] number of items showing. 
If ListSize matches number of list items it will

&#160;&#160; The "X" was added to provide a clean way to escape
the window if an error occurs such as, for example, creating a message window
with the buttons pushed down out of sight. Without the "X" those situations

An IE object is only created for the duration of the message window

<H4>Troubleshooting</H4>

<B>Buttons too close to bottom, or partially hidden:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; Several methods were tested to control the window layout. The present method seemed
to be the best. It uses a TABLE with 30 pixels padding at the bottom to wrap the TABLE containing the
buttons. It also calculates 40 pixels extra height to account for the title bar. If you find an unusual situation
where the buttons are partially hidden at the bottom of the window, try adjusting the value in the STYLE
tage where it says:<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="Maroon">#ButBox {padding-bottom:</SPAN><BR>
Another option would be to adjust the value calculations for <SPAN CLASS="TMaroon">HtBox</SPAN>, which is
the variable used for the total window height.<BR><BR>

<B>First message is not visible:</B><BR>
&#160;&#160; This is an odd problem. It seems to be a bug with IE8. The scripts were tested on
XP, Win7 and Win8, with both IE6 and IE8 on XP. The problem appears on Win7, on XP with IE8, but not on XP with IE6, indicating that it
seems to be an IE issue rather than a Windows version issue.<BR><BR>
&#160;&#160;
The symptom of the problem is that the first time a custom MsgBox is used,
the message box does not show. The demo scripts are designed to show the MsgBox and then show
a message telling which button was clicked. In this case, the first thing that appears is a message
saying something like "Button 2 was clicked"! After the first run it works fine, until next reboot. It's as though something
needed to be intialized. WSH? IE? Mshta.exe? Perhaps it could be a service that needs to be started?
 I can't think of any logical explanation for the problem. It does not happen on XP with IE6. <BR><BR>

&#160;&#160; The <B>Init</B> sub was added to solve the problem. <B>Init</B>, which should be called when the
 class is created on systems that don't have IE6, "primes the pump" by creating and then closing an HTA window without
displaying it onscreen. See the <A HREF="#a0"> Init</A> listing for more info.
