Custom MsgBox script class
__________________________

UPDATE 1/2014: There are two aspects to this update -

1) A minor bug fix: The msgbox scripts were using a string "ID1"
in the Init sub that "primes the pump" for creating message windows.
In some cases, for unknown reasons, the HTA can be left running
(as seen in Task Manager) if the ID used is not a unique string.
That problem was fixed.

2) A new script and class provides an output window that
can be written to during a script's running. It's fairly basic.
See the demo script and help in the Output Window folder.

  Ensuring that the message window works without leaving
any instances of IE or mshta running is a tricky business.
The first version of the output window left both an IE instance 
and an mshta instance running on Win7, but not on XP!
Stranger still, the window would fail to display if the Cls_HTA1
variable (holding the HTA window reference) was not local to 
the Show sub. The variable could be assigned to a class-global
variable at the end of the sub to enable cleanup later, but
a class-global variable used to set up the window would simply 
fail to work! 
  The versions of the scripts here have been tested on WinXP 
and Win7 to ensure that they fully clean up all IE and mshta
instances.

    These are updated scripts that use a changed
method from what worked on XP and earlier. Some ideas were borrowed 
from Tom Lavedas, who frequents the VBScript newsgroup, but the major 
change is based on a very odd hack that has been known online for some time. 
This hack allows for creating an HTA window in script, which avoids security 
problems and also allows for a "normal" looking MsgBox window.

>> The latest version works on all systems, including Windows 8. <<


  See the updated help for explanation of how everything works. For the
most part the new (2012) version is the same as the older version. It is
a self-sizing window that provides options for a listbox, textbox, icon/image
and one or more buttons. The main difference with the newer version is
just that it uses an HTA to avoid security restrictions.

Basic MsgBox Sample.vbs - A very basic message box demo.

MsgWithList.vbs - is a demo of the new class that creates
3 different message box windows.

 pickafruit.vbs - is a simpler demo that shows how the selector and
text input can be used together.

The image files are for the demos. They will only show if you edit
the scripts. Unfortunately, since these scripts create an IE/HTA
window and write to it dynamically, there is no path for the document.
That means that a relative path cannot be used for images. In other
words, if you load a page from C:\pages you can have images in that
page like so:  <IMG SRC="image1.jpg">
...as long as image1.jpg is in the C:\pages folder. But in this case IE
doesn't know the path of it's loaded document. It's officially "about:blank".
So any images used for the Icon property must be entered with their full path.

  See the help file in the folder. This is a simplified class
that displays an updateable output window for use during
script running.
