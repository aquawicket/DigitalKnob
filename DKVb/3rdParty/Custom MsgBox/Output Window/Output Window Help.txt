Output Window Class

  The script here provides a class that can be pasted at the
end of any script to provide an output window. Text can be added
to the window at any point while a script is running. The window
can also be closed and recreated. It works by setting up a TEXTAREA
control in an HTA. The basic mechanism is the same as the custom 
MsgBox.

  The output window is simpler than the MsgBox class. The following 
options are available:

 Property Title - Text in window title bar.
 
 Property OutputFontColor - Color of output text as HTML hex code. Defaults to "000000".
 
 Property OutputBackColor - Color of output background as HTML hex code. Defaults to "FFFFFF".
  
 Property MsgStyle - Boolean. If set to true the output window displays with the system
                             colors of a MsgBox and the TEXTAREA has no border.
  
 Property Width - Number of columns.
 
 Property Height - Number of rows vertically.

 Sub Show - Show the output window.
 
 Sub Output(outText) - Adds text to the output window.
 
 Sub ClearOutput - Clears output window text.
 
 Sub CloseWindow - Closes output window.

  The window background and title bar match the system colors.
The adjustable properties need only be set once for the life of
the class, but may also be changed between displays. 

  The output window is meant for use with long scripts, when some
kind of updating display is needed. When the script ends, any
open output window will close. But while the script is running
an output window can be left open without any looping
required because it's an IE window.

  As written, the window can be closed by the script or by clicking
on the x at upper right of the output window. The class does not
provide a check to make sure the window is open before writing
to it. If the window has been closed the write will simply fail.
If desired, the Output sub could be changed to a Boolean function,
so that one could show a new window is the existing one is
closed through the GUI. Alternatively, the webpage code for the
window can be changed to remove the "x" by changing sysmenu=yes
(in APage(0)) to sysmenu=no. That would prevent the window being
closed except by the script.
