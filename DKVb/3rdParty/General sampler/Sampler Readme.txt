General sample pack
__________________________________________________________________
 
VBScript samples from JSWare - www.jsware.net
__________________________________________________________________

   These scripts are primarily intended as examples for people interested in
scripting. They've been tested for functionality. Nevertheless, you can't
assume that they''ll always 'just work'. Your configuration may be different. 
You use them at your own risk. Feel free to change them or distribute them.  

 Many of the sampler scripts were written circa 2000. The latest package
has been updated as of Dec., 2011. Many of the older scripts were only
relevant on Windows 98/ME. The latest batch have been written on XP.
 
  If you open these scripts in Notepad you'll see comments at the top
that explain their purpose.

  Many of these scripts use an InputBox to get information. A much
easier method in many cases is drag/drop, however, drag/drop in Vista/7
can be a problem due to extreme restrictions. See "Vista-7 drop option.vbs"
for options.
