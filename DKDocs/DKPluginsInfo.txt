"A DKPlugin"

A DKPlugins is a folder, it's contents are compaitble with DigitalKnob.  i.e. DKPlugins/MyPlugin
A DKPlugin can be anything from c++ files, to html, javascript, or just file assets ,.png,.txt.etc.
Every Plugin must include a DKCMake.txt file to run.
Every Plugin must be located in the digitalknob/DKPlugins folder


*** DKASSETS() ***
/DKPlugins/MyPlugin/DKCmake.txt -> "DKASSETS(MyPlugin)"
This is the easiest version of a plugin, anything in the "DKPlugins/MyPlugin" folder will be copied to the app's assets

*** DKDEPEND() ***
When a Plugin depends on another plugin, specify DKDEPEND(DKPluginName)

For example, DKPng requires DKZlib..   
The DKCmake.txt file in the /DKPlugins/DKPng folder will state...
DKDEPEND(DKZlib)
This command will ensure DKZlib is built first and recognied by DKPng.

*** DKINCLUDE() ***
Source code need's to include header file locations.
we can eaisly say DKINCLUDE("C:/Users/username/digitalknob/DKPlugins/3rdParty/vorbis/include")
This will allow DKPlugins and the DKApp to see these header files. 

*** DKPLUGIN() ***
When we use c++ files to work with DK, we need to compile them.
I.E. DKPLUGIN(MyPlugin) will compile to a library to be linked to your app.

*** DEBUG_LIB() ***
This will include a static library into the app.  (please use platfrom spacific commands below)

*** RELEASE_LIB() ***
This will include a static library into the app.  (please use platfrom spacific commands below)
