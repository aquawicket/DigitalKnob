><p>Last week I was stuck chasing an annoying bug. You know the kind: rando=
m crash, happens about once every 20 or 30 runs when the CI runs unit tests=
, can=E2=80=99t be reproduced by hand, doesn=E2=80=99t show-up on <a href=
=3D"http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>=E2=80=A6</p><p>My first idea was to =
try something more aggressive. I recompiled my code with <a href=3D"https:/=
/github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a> (=
ASAN) which usually catches things that Valgrind didn=E2=80=99t, but still =
no luck.</p><p>Next step was to also recompile externals deps with ASAN, be=
cause I suspected that maybe the issue was happening inside them (possibly =
due to a faulty use of mine) and ASAN can only find issues that happens ins=
ide the code built with it. Of course in C++ we=E2=80=99re still figuring o=
ut how to make reusable packages that work with usual flags, so almost none=
 of them has a simple way to work with ASAN. I=E2=80=99ll come back to that=
 part later.</p><p>Facing the perspective of needing to patch a couple Cona=
n recipes for ASAN, I took a break and started to wonder if maybe the issue=
 was a threading issue. Race conditions could explain why it was near impos=
sible to reproduce. Fortunately ASAN is not the only one of its kind, there=
=E2=80=99s also (among others) <a href=3D"https://github.com/google/sanitiz=
ers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual">ThreadSanitizer</a> (TSAN) that speciali=
zes in data races bugs.</p><p>I rebuilt my test with <code class=3D"languag=
e-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fsanitize=3Dthread</code> and went on my me=
rry way:</p><p><code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g++: er=
ror: -fsanitize=3Dthread linking must be done with -pie or -shared</code></=
p><p>Oops, I forgot to add <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-ro=
uge">-pie</code> and <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-=
fPIE</code> as suggested in the doc. Let=E2=80=99s try again:</p><p><code c=
lass=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld: gtest/lib/libgtest.a(gtes=
t-all.cc.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `_ZTVN7testing8internal17TestE=
ventRepeaterE' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with =
-fPIC</code></p><p>Still not good. My gtest library was not built for posit=
ion-independent code :(</p><h3 id=3D"pics-and-pies">Pics and pies</h3><p>Po=
sition-independent code (PIC) is a very old thing (in computer science term=
s, of course). Back before we had MMUs and paging, all processes had to sha=
re physical address space, so it quickly made sense to make sure a program =
could be loaded at any address. When CPUs evolved and each process could ha=
ve its own logical address space arbitrarly mapped to any physical address,=
 PIC was not mandatory anymore.</p><p>It came back with shared libraries. T=
he reason we are taught early to put <code class=3D"language-plaintext high=
lighter-rouge">-fPIC</code> when we build <code class=3D"language-plaintext=
 highlighter-rouge">.so</code> files is to ensure that the same code can be=
 used by multiple process which will map the same physical memory to variou=
s virtual addresses. Practicaly it eliminates all absolute addressing, repl=
acing it with either relative addressing or a small jump table that can be =
forked for each process. It also comes with a small cost, which is why it=
=E2=80=99s not always enabled by default (more about that later).</p><p>Bef=
ore the early 2000s, PIC was limited to shared libaries. Executables still =
used absolute addressing as you can depend on PIC when you=E2=80=99re not P=
IC, but not the other way around. With the advent of <a href=3D"https://en.=
wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">Address Space Layout=
 Randomization</a> (ASLR), it started making sense to also make executables=
 Position Independent so that their memory map could not be predicted by at=
tackers, rendering buffer-overflow exploits much more complicated to pull-o=
ut.</p><p>Operating systems today will check if an executable is Position I=
ndependent (PIE) and if so enable ASLR. Your compiler may or may not enforc=
e this by default depending on your system.</p><p>In practice Position Inde=
pendent shared libraries are created from objects built with <code class=3D=
"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIC</code> and Position Independen=
t Executables are created from objects built with <code class=3D"language-p=
laintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIE</code>.</p><h3 id=3D"mixing-up-binaries">=
Mixing-up binaries</h3><p>Of course since we=E2=80=99re doing native code, =
this means this is yet another thing to keep in mind to determine whether o=
r not binaries can work together. The <a href=3D"https://gcc.gnu.org/online=
docs/gcc-7.2.0/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options">documentation</a=
> can be hard to process so here=E2=80=99s a summary:</p><ul><li>Position I=
ndependent executables may be created from PIC or PIE objects (<code class=
=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.o</code>) and PIC or PIE static =
libraries (<code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.a</code>)<=
/li><li>PIC shared libraries can only be created from PIC objects or static=
 libraries</li><li>Non-PIE executables<sup>1</sup> can be created from any =
objects or static libraries</li></ul><p>In practice, the most simple soluti=
on would be to build everything with <code class=3D"language-plaintext high=
lighter-rouge">-fPIC</code> and be done with it. But this is C++, we like t=
o brag about the fact that we only pay for what we use, so obviously a fine=
r rule may be needed:</p><ul><li>If the object is to be linked as a shared =
library, or a static library that will in turn be linked in a shared librar=
y, use <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIC</code></l=
i><li>If the object is to be linked as a position indenpendent executable, =
or astatic library that will in turn be linked in position independent exec=
utable, use <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIE</cod=
e></li><li>Else, use neither</li></ul><h3 id=3D"the-obligatory-paragraph-ab=
out-build-systems-and-package-managers">The obligatory paragraph about buil=
d systems and package managers</h3><p>Ideally, one would prefer to just spe=
cify what it wants (a shared library, a static library, a position-independ=
ent executable) and let someone else figure out which flag to use where. A =
build system for example=E2=80=A6</p><p>In practice, support is still limit=
ed. In CMake for example you can set the <code class=3D"language-plaintext =
highlighter-rouge">POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</code> property on a target an=
d let it set the right flags. It=E2=80=99s even on by default for shared li=
braries. Unfortunately, it only sets the flags for the compiler, not for th=
e linker (it lacks <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-pi=
e</code> when linking executables), meaning the result binary will not be a=
 PIE. There=E2=80=99s been an issue opened for some time: <a href=3D"https:=
//gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/14983">https://gitlab.kitware.com/c=
make/cmake/issues/14983</a>.</p><p>At package management level, Conan has n=
o support for PIC/PIE either. You could try add the profile to your profile=
 but it wouldn=E2=80=99t work, since PIE requires to add <code class=3D"lan=
guage-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-pie</code> to link flags only when link=
ing executables, so if you add to your <code class=3D"language-plaintext hi=
ghlighter-rouge">LDFLAGS</code> you won=E2=80=99t be able to link shared li=
braries anymore. A more native setting would be required, that would set th=
e right flags for each generator (CMake, Autotools=E2=80=A6) and possibly s=
ome workaround in package recipes too.</p><p>In my case, I =E2=80=9Csolved =
the issue=E2=80=9D by enforcing <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlight=
er-rouge">-fPIC</code> in my Conan profile, then patching the recipe of the=
 final executable to add <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-roug=
e">-pie</code> by hand using <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-=
rouge">CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS</code>. It wasn=E2=80=99t pretty and would pr=
obably be hard to scale but it did the job.</p><h3 id=3D"performance-and-fi=
nal-words">Performance and final words</h3><p>Position Independent Code is =
a very useful feature that=E2=80=99s been here for a long time, but is stil=
l weakly supported by our C++ ecosystem. Unless enforced as the default by =
the compiler (you can build gcc/clang that way) it is quite painful to depl=
oy as soon as you start dealing with projects that mix-up various libraries=
. The issue is further complicated by the fact that it works in =E2=80=9Cre=
verse=E2=80=9D: you must know how your code will be finally linked at the t=
ime you compile it (something you probably can=E2=80=99t know if you publis=
h a library).</p><p>Package managers (and to a lesser extent build systems)=
 can help with that but are still far from perfect on the matter.</p><p>In =
the end the easiest solution might simply be to always compile with <code c=
lass=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIC</code>, and let the fin=
al linker decide if it wants a PIE or not. I did not run the benchmarks, bu=
t it seems like the impact is negligible for general purpose x86_64 code. I=
t is not as easy on x86 32 bits: according to <a href=3D"http://nebelwelt.n=
et/publications/files/12TRpie.pdf">this paper</a>, you should expect a 10% =
overhead on average.</p><p>There is also an impact from using <code class=
=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIC</code> in cases where only =
<code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fPIE</code> would hav=
e been enough, but it is difficult to quantify. If there are compilers/link=
ers gurus among my readers, I would be glad to have the exact details. I wo=
uld expect an even smaller impact than between <code class=3D"language-plai=
ntext highlighter-rouge">-fPIC</code> and nothing. When in doubt, you could=
 try to benchmark both on your use case and decide whether or not it=E2=80=
=99s worth patching all your toolchain to handle that properly, especially =
given the weak support from existing build tools.</p><p>As for my random bu=
g, as it turned out TSAN didn=E2=80=99t find anything either, but at least =
I got a topic for my blog :)</p><p><sup>1</sup> I know, =E2=80=9CPIE execut=
