**** The Build System ****

DigitalKnob depends on GIT and CMake

GIT will always be installed
CMake will always be installed

On certain platfroms, other Tools will be installed.
For example, Visual Studio needs to be installed before CMake.
So CMake can find Visual Studio when it runs. 

For resons like this, we cannot rely soley on CMake to do everything.

We need a prep app that will install GIT, CMAKE, VisualStudio, and anything technically required by CMake.


So far...   on all platforms, 
Before we can run CMake..
we need GIT
we need CMake
for Windows we need Visual Studio
for Mac we need Xcode
and for Linux we need build-essentials

Android = etc.
iOS = etc.
